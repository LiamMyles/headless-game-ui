# Introduction

As the year rolled into 2025 I made a promise to myself that I would create 4 mini games, 1 in each quarter of 2025.

Who knows how far this project will go, however I do want to eventually make a suite of components that can used to inject a bit of whimsy into the world. I aim to one day bring these games to the standard of other headless ui libraries in terms of customisation and accessibility.

This current component doesn't align with all of my goals, but it's a little game that is an MVP to deploy for my Q1 deadline, but I hope to expand it going forward as I continue to develop other mini games.

# Quick Time Game

## What is it?

It's a reaction game, where you must enter the keys before the timer runs out. For those quick enough, you will be rewarded with a magical surprise.

## How to play

Using your keyboard, use the arrow keys to beat the game, moving them in the direction indicated.

To reset and try again press [Enter].
